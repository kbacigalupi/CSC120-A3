Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Anna Boden & Katie Wilson & Joanna Li 
Anna has already used Java before, and was helpful in understanding the differences between Arrays and ArrayLists. She also knew more about the syntax. 
I did not know what Javadoc comments were or how to implement and Joanna and I asked other people at office hours. 
Katie and I talked a lot about how to mirror words. 
Joanna and I also compared code at the Sunday September 25th office hours. She helped brainstorm how to replace me/I in the grammatically incorrect situation. 
While there are still several pieces of incorrect grammar (ex. "they are my" turns into "they am your"), and I did not add code to detect punctuation on code words(you? does not change to me?), talking to others helped me get as far as I did in terms of 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Wednesday September 21st 7-9
Sunday September 25th 1-3

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it can be more powerful than python in the ways that many different objects can easily work together. However, the complicated syntax was a little frustrating. I am terrible at using the java documentation right now. While I know the only way to get better at it is using the website more, it's a little bit frustrating. Understanding the syntax of calling methods (.add(), .get(), etc.) versus creating objects (ex. a string array) confuses me. I think as I get a better hold of how to use a class vs. object vs. instance and how they all can work together, the syntax will make more sense to me. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
A lot of the challenging part comes in the abstraction or thinking through what I want the computer to do. However, once I've thought about this translating the code into java syntax is even harder. I think that while Java is more confusing to learn, there seem to be many ways to use it. The extensive list of libraries & methods in the documentation shows how many different ways Java can be used. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Like we've been told over and over, it was helpful to talk to other people about their code. Although everyone's code was surprisingly different for such a relatively simple assignment, many people had different approaches to solving the problem. I think asking other people specific questions was helpful. It made me realize what I didn't know, and also what many of my classmates collectively don't know. I felt less alone as I navigated the same issues with everyone else. I also think writing the mirror function as a seperate function was really helpful.
